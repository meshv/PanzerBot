# PanzerBot
PanzerBot is (for the momment) a Discord exclusive bot. PanzerBot uses IPC and WebSockets to provide a realtime (online) control panel of the bot. We are always looking for features to add to PanzerBot
# Future
Our plans for the future
* Make a similar Twitch Bot which will help make a streamer's life easier
* Add user suggested features
* Make the Discord bot work with other sites and APIs to provide an enriched user expierience
* Add some sort of machine learning or other fun feature to interact with users
